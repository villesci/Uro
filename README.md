This is the R project containing the data and scripts for chapter 1 of my thesis. These two rmarkdown scripts independently run the environmental habitat temperature extractions and perform thermal tolerance and warming tolerance calculations in one script, with developmental traits in the other. There is also a r doc showing the breakdown of ramping rates for the heatbar.
